(Updated May 2024)

## Family

I'll be married for 15 years (!) in July 2024. They've been pretty amazing. I
wouldn't trade them for anything.

My girls finished 7th and 2nd grade. This time next year my oldest will be
preparing for high school and marching band. Truly, the days are long and the
years are short. Trying to get the older one to finish the Harry Potter series,
but she's stuck on Order of the Phoenix and keeps picking up Riordan's books
again.

## Work

Mouser Electronics is still a great place to work. Hopefully we can start
some foundation repair on the website and enable easier development. I enjoy
working more on system architecture and development instead of being in ops.

## Sports

Its awesome that the Mavs (basketball) and the Stars (hockey) are in their
respective conference finals. Hopefully ABC/ESPN gets to do lots of scheduling
fun with the American Airlines center.

Alabama football is going to look different this year. I'm optimistic, but
I'd also be content with an 8-4 season this year. New-look SEC + new coach is
likely a recipe for weirdness.

## Video Games

EA College Football 25 better not be bad. Mostly been playing old school SNES
RPGs and Mario RPG remakes. Nothing incredible on the horizon that I'm looking
forward to.

## Books

Waiting patiently for Wind and Truth (Stormlight Book Five). Excited about my
Leatherbound Words of Radiance. Yes, I've fully accepted that I'm giving
Brandon Sanderson lots of money. However, he keeps giving me books, so it is a
fair trade.
