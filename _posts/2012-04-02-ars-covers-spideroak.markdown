SpiderOak is pretty awesome. It is slightly more complicated than Dropbox to
set up. However, the effort they have made to make sure that your data is
secured more than makes up for it. I'm not saying that Dropbox doesn't care
about your data. SpiderOak is just thorough about making sure your privacy is
protected.
