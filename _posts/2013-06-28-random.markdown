Some random thoughts about things that are happening:

Anyone complaining about Netflix wanting DRM in HTML5 is a fool. Content
providers are not going to let Netflix stream in a format that can be easily
ripped. Would you rather deal with plugins or have a standard framework to deal
with the DRM? I know what I want, and its more streaming content - which means
DRM. 

Logstash + Kibana is awesome. I need to do more grok filtering and tagging to
make it even more useful.

Configuration Management is a busy place. Chef, Puppet, Salt, Ansible,
CFengine, SCCM, and Powershell Desired State Management. A little overwhelming,
and almost too many choices.

Interesting that Microsoft is moving to a faster release cadence - that was
one area VMware was going destroy Hyper-V, and Microsoft decided to reduce
the advantage. Good for them.

iOS 7 looks promising - should be an interesting year for Apple.

HAProxy is my new best friend. I plan on writing a couple of HOWTOs for various
things, including the new SSL feature.

My baby girl is two. How time flies.
